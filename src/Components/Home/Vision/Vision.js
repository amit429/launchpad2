                  Built for Bharat is a term that refers to startups that are focused on creating solutions and products for the masses in India, particularly those who live in smaller towns and rural areas. Bharat, in this context, represents the non-urban areas of India. The startups who recognize that there is a huge untapped market in these areas and are creating innovative products and services that cater to the unique needs of people living in these areas. 
                  Startups who are working on solving a wide range of challenges faced by people living in rural areas, including access to education, healthcare, financial services, and e-commerce. For example, they are creating mobile apps that allow farmers to connect with buyers directly, digital platforms that provide access to affordable healthcare services, and innovative financial products that cater to the needs of people living in remote areas.
